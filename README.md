# WikiHow Network Analysis through Data Mining and Network Graph Modelling

This segment focuses on the preliminary stage of the project, which involves the extraction of valuable information from WikiHow pages through web scraping techniques. The primary objective is to gather comprehensive data about various articles, including their main headings, subheadings, categories, ratings, views, and other pertinent details. By utilizing libraries such as BeautifulSoup and requests in Python, the code accesses and parses the HTML content of WikiHow pages, extracting the desired information. Once extracted, the data is structured and cleaned to ensure consistency and reliability. This phase serves as the foundation for subsequent analysis, providing a rich dataset that captures the breadth and depth of content available on WikiHow.

## Part 1: Data Mining and Processing

This part of the project involves extracting relevant information from WikiHow pages using web scraping techniques. The data mining process includes obtaining main headings, subheadings, categories, ratings, views, and other useful information from WikiHow articles. The extracted data is then cleaned and processed to create a structured dataset. This dataset serves as the foundation for analyzing category relationships and key topics in WikiHow articles.

## Part 2: Graph Construction and Analysis

In the second part of the project, the focus shifts to analyzing the extracted dataset to uncover meaningful insights into category relationships and key topics within the WikiHow platform. Network analysis techniques, implemented using the NetworkX library in Python, are employed to construct a graph representation of the relationships between different categories and subcategories. By modeling WikiHow articles as nodes and their connections as edges, the graph offers a visual and quantitative understanding of the interrelatedness and significance of various topics. Metrics such as degree distribution, PageRank, diameter, and centrality measures are calculated to quantify the importance and centrality of different categories and topics within the WikiHow network. Additionally, visualizations such as network graphs and histograms are generated to illustrate the structure of the WikiHow network and identify prominent categories and topics. Through this comprehensive analysis, valuable insights are gained into the underlying structure and content distribution of WikiHow articles, facilitating a deeper understanding of the platform's knowledge base and user interests.
